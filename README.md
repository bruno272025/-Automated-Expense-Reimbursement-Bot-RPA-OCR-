# -Automated-Expense-Reimbursement-Bot-RPA-OCR-
Python &amp; This project is a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) bot developed in Python to streamline and validate expense reimbursement requests automatically. The script reads "pending" requests from a Google Sheet, uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the total amount from receipt images, and compares the values to approve or reject the request, updating the status directly on the spreadsheet.

The main goal is to eliminate manual verification, reduce human error, and dramatically accelerate the reimbursement approval cycle.
